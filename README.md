# rolodexter — Joe Maristela’s Research & Information Portal

> **NOTE:** This repository is currently under rapid reconstruction and content migration. Check back regularly for major updates, new research notes, and expanded resources!

Welcome to my public research, notes, and professional information portal. Here you’ll find living research notes, project links, and knowledge scaffolding across science, technology, consciousness studies, and more. All work here is independent and not affiliated with any organization unless explicitly stated.

## 🧑‍🔬 For Investors & Researchers

- **Technical Feasibility:** rolodexter builds on proven agent frameworks (see [agent technologies note](projects/rolodexter/agents/notes/2025-05-11-agent-technologies-inspiration.md)), foundation models, and modern memory systems.
- **Differentiation:** Executive-functioning agent orchestration, modular knowledge/memory integration, and system-level automation.
- **Deep Dives:**
  - [Knowledge & Memory Systems](projects/rolodexter/systems/README.md)
  - [Agent Architecture](projects/rolodexter/agents/README.md)
  - [rolodexterLABS: Empirical R&D](projects/rolodexterLABS/README.md)
- **FAQ:**
  - _How does rolodexter achieve persistent, context-aware reasoning?_  
    → By combining semantic knowledge bases, agent memory, and LLM-powered retrieval.
  - _Can agents operate autonomously on real systems?_  
    → Yes. See [rolodexterWIN](projects/rolodexter/agents/rolodexterWIN.md) and system integration docs.
  - _What frameworks or models are supported?_  
    → rolodexter is framework-agnostic, supporting integration with Python, LLM APIs, OS-level hooks, and more.

## 🧬 Philosophical Foundation

rolodexter draws inspiration from Donald Hoffman’s “conscious agent” theories, exploring whether similar principles of consciousness and agency can emerge in artificial systems.
