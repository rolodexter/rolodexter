# Books & Academic Publications

## Overview

This directory contains my ongoing literary and academic works, representing significant contributions across multiple disciplines. My unique background combining Systems Science (Ph.D.), Medicine (M.D.), and hands-on AI leadership experience enables me to bridge theoretical foundations with practical implementations in unprecedented ways.

## Academic Publications

### Flagship Academic Textbooks

1. [**AI Data Agents: Theory, Architecture, and Implementation**](./nonfiction/academic/ai-data-agents/ai-data-agents-textbook.md)
   - First comprehensive academic textbook on AI Data Agents as a formal discipline
   - Establishes canonical definitions and frameworks for agent-based systems
   - Bridges theoretical foundations with production experience
   - Status: In active development (2025), ~800-1000 pages across 24 chapters

2. [**Rendering Knowledge: A Level-of-Detail Framework**](./nonfiction/rendering-knowledge/README.md)
   - Novel framework applying LOD concepts to knowledge systems
   - Introduces the D₀-D₅ epistemic stack model
   - Formal treatment of knowledge as navigable terrain
   - Status: Parts I-III completed (~400 pages), full work projected 800-1000 pages

### Synergy Between Works
These two academic textbooks complement each other in significant ways:
- **AI Data Agents** provides the foundational architecture for intelligent systems
- **Rendering Knowledge** establishes the theoretical framework for knowledge navigation
- Together they form a comprehensive approach to next-generation AI systems
