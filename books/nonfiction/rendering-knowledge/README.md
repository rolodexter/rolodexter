**Author:** Joe Maristela ("rolodexter")  
**Status:** In Active Development (2025)  
**Academic Level:** Post-Doctoral / Graduate Textbook  
**Target Publication:** Academic Press, 2025-2026  
**Current Progress:** Parts I-III completed (Chapters 1-4.11), ~400+ pages drafted  
**Length:** Projected 800-1000 pages, 24 chapters across 6 major parts

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive academic textbook that introduces a novel interdisciplinary framework treating **knowledge as navigable terrain** and applying **Level-of-Detail (LOD) rendering** concepts from computer graphics to cognitive science, epistemology, and knowledge systems design. This work bridges theories from information theory, cognitive science, AI, and education to create a formal framework for understanding how knowledge can be structured, traversed, and rendered at variable resolution.

## Academic Innovation & Contributions

- **Novel Theoretical Framework:** First systematic application of LOD rendering concepts to epistemic and cognitive systems
- **The Epistemic Stack:** Original Dâ‚€-Dâ‚… stratification model (Signal â†’ Information â†’ Schema â†’ Wisdom â†’ Culture â†’ Generativity)
- **Semantic Terrain Theory:** Formal treatment of knowledge as navigable, structured space
- **Traversal Grammars:** Systematic approach to planning and validating movement through knowledge layers
- **Cross-Modal Rendering:** Integration of text, mathematics, code, and visual knowledge representation
