# Notes

This folder contains chronological notes, logs, and work journals. Use this space to quickly jot down ideas, meeting notes, daily logs, or brainstorming sessions. These notes can later be referenced or formalized into content in the `projects` or `prompts` folders.

## Conventions
- Use filenames like `YYYY-MM-DD.md` for daily notes (e.g., `2025-05-11.md`).
- Add links to relevant notes in project or prompt docs as needed.
