**Hypothesis:** Some UAPs are coherent plasmoid entities capable of transiently interacting with electromagnetic systemsâ€”including consciousness-related neuroelectric fields.

**Testable Idea:** Construct a controlled test site using a high-resolution, multi-band electromagnetic sensor array (similar to the Tedesco setup) co-located with magnetoencephalography (MEG) labs monitoring cognitive disturbances in volunteers during anomalous plasma events (e.g. controlled ball lightning experiments).
