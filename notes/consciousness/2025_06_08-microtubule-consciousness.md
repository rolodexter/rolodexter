**Hypothesis:** Consciousness is not merely information-processing, but a coherent quantum field phenomenon involving entanglement across microtubule networksâ€”capable of interfacing with external EM systems under extreme stress conditions.

**Testable Idea:** Use cryogenically cooled neural tissue (e.g., rat hippocampus slices) exposed to femtosecond laser-induced microbursts to test for signatures of quantum coherence using superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs).
