**Hypothesis:** The notion of consciousness "upload" can be reframed not as digital simulation but as neural state isomorphism transferred via entangled phase locking across two synchronized quantum-coherent substrates.

**Testable Idea:** Implement ultra-high-density neural mapping on animals using optogenetic neural synchronization, paired with a second "blank" neural model to test for isomorphic state induction (e.g., using AI-spiked connectome mirroring).
