**Hypothesis:** Remote viewing may tap into resonance structures in Earth's subsurface electromagnetic environmentâ€”functioning analogously to long-baseline interferometry using consciousness as a coherence medium.

**Testable Idea:** Use double-blind remote viewing sessions over regions with documented subsurface EM anomalies (e.g., seismic fault zones or DUMBs), cross-referencing subject performance with geomagnetic activity and Schumann resonance metrics.
