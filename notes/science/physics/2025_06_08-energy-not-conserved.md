**Hypothesis:** Traditional energy conservation laws break down in curved, expanding spacetime, suggesting that energy is an emergent quantity from deeper symmetry-based or information-theoretic constructs.

**Testable Idea:** Use cold atom interferometry to empirically validate coordinate-invariant "gravitational charges" (Sinya Aokiâ€™s approach) by testing if quantum systems can distinguish pseudotensor-based gravitational energy from covariant definitions in rotating frame experiments.
