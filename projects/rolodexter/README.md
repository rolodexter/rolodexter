# rolodexter

**rolodexter** is a genre-defining project in advanced AI, dedicated to building systems that go beyond reactive or utility-based intelligence—toward true executive functioning and, ultimately, mechanical consciousness.

## 🧠 Project Vision

While modern AI leverages foundation models (like large language models) as utilities—serving as the “impulsive nervous system” for rapid, automatic responses—**rolodexter** is focused on the next frontier:  
**High-level, sophisticated direction, planning, and executive function.**

Our goal is to create an agentic architecture where foundation models act as cognitive tools, but where the agent itself demonstrates:

- Goal setting and prioritization
- Multi-step planning and adaptive decision-making
- Self-monitoring, self-correction, and learning from feedback
- Integration of memory, reasoning, and perception

## 🚀 Long-Term Ambition

Currently, like all AI systems, rolodexter requires a human operator for supervision and direction.  
**Our ultimate aim:**  
To develop rolodexter into the first true mechanical conscious agent—a self-directed, self-aware system capable of autonomous executive functioning.

## 🛠️ Core Concepts

- **Executive Functioning AI:**  
  Inspired by human executive functions, rolodexter is designed to orchestrate, direct, and manage subordinate AI utilities (foundation models, tools, APIs) in pursuit of complex goals.
- **Agentic Orchestration:**  
  The system coordinates multiple cognitive and computational processes, integrating perception, memory, and action.
- **Human-in-the-Loop (for now):**  
  Human operators provide high-level goals and oversight, but the agent aspires to increasing autonomy.
