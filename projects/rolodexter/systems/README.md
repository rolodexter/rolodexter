# rolodexter Knowledge Systems

This document outlines the high-level approach to designing and developing knowledge systems within the rolodexter ecosystem, and clarifies the distinction and interplay between knowledge systems and memory systems.

## ðŸ§  General Knowledge System Approach

In rolodexter, a knowledge system is an organized framework for acquiring, structuring, updating, and utilizing information. Our approach emphasizes:

- **Modularity:** Knowledge is organized into discrete, interoperable modules (notes, documents, code, ontologies, etc).
- **Semantic Structure:** Information is linked, tagged, and categorized for contextual retrieval.
- **Agent Operability:** All knowledge is accessible and actionable by rolodexter agents, supporting reasoning, planning, and execution.
- **Continuous Evolution:** Knowledge systems are designed to evolve as new data, insights, and agent capabilities emerge.

## ðŸ§¬ Knowledge System vs. Memory System

**Knowledge System:**
- A persistent, structured repository of information, concepts, and relationships.
- Includes curated documents, ontologies, codebases, research notes, and more.
- Supports high-level reasoning, learning, and decision-making by agents and users.

**Memory System:**
- The dynamic, context-sensitive storage and retrieval of experiences, events, and state.
- Includes episodic memory (what happened), working memory (current context), and procedural memory (how to do things).
- Enables agents to remember, adapt, and personalize interactions over time.

## ðŸ”„ Interdependence & Impact

- **Integration:** Knowledge systems provide the foundational content and structure; memory systems enable context-aware access, adaptation, and learning.
- **Feedback Loop:** As agents interact with the world, memory systems capture new information, which can be curated and promoted into the knowledge system.
- **Ecosystem Effect:** The synergy between knowledge and memory systems powers rolodexterâ€™s executive functioning, enabling both robust knowledge management and adaptive, intelligent behavior.

## ðŸ“š Example Components
- Knowledge Base: Curated documents, ontologies, research notes
- Memory Store: Episodic logs, user preferences, agent state
- Retrieval Engine: Semantic and contextual search
- Agent Interface: Unified access for querying, updating, and reasoning
