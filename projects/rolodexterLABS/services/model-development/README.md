# Model Development Service

The **Model Development** service at rolodexterLABS focuses on the research, design, training, and evaluation of advanced AI models to power the rolodexter ecosystem.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To create, refine, and maintain machine learning models that serve as the cognitive and computational core for rolodexter’s executive-functioning agents and applications.

---

## 🛠️ Activities

- **Model Research:**  
  Investigating state-of-the-art architectures, foundation models, and techniques relevant to executive-functioning AI.
- **Prototyping:**  
  Building and testing new model architectures, including LLMs, transformers, and specialized submodules.
- **Training:**  
  Running experiments with various datasets, hyperparameters, and training protocols.
- **Evaluation:**  
  Benchmarking model performance, robustness, and alignment with rolodexter’s goals.
- **Deployment:**  
  Integrating models into the broader rolodexter system for empirical testing and real-world use.
